## What Can Toko Do?

Toko is flexible for any server. Here’s just a taste:

- **Moderation:** Warnings, bans, mutes, automod, anti-spam, and more
- **Logging:** Track edits, deletes, joins, leaves, and almost everything else
- **Economy:** Server currency, leaderboards, shops, rewards, and games
- **Tickets:** Private channels for support, suggestions, or reports (coming soon)
- **Fun & Games:** Mini-games, polls, interactive commands
- **Utilities:** Timers, reminders, info commands, and a bunch more

…and that’s just the start. Explore the [Modules](./modules/utility) section for everything Toko can do.
