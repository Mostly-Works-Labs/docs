# Welcome to Toko

Toko is your all-in-one toolkit for Revolt servers. Whether you're running a community, a friend group, or a project hub, Toko helps you keep things smooth, safe, and fun—without the stress.

Toko has a **ton** of features (way more than just moderation, logging, or economy). From powerful admin tools to games, tickets, and utilities, we’re always rolling out new things based on your feedback.

## What Can Toko Do?

Toko is built to be flexible. Here’s a glimpse at what’s possible:

- **Moderation:** Warnings, bans, mutes, anti-spam, automod, and more
- **Logging:** Track edits, deletes, joins, leaves, and just about everything else
- **Economy:** Server currency, rewards, leaderboards, shops, and fun games
- **Tickets:** Create private channels for support, reports, suggestions, and more (rolling out soon)
- **Fun & Games:** Mini-games, polls, and interactive chat commands
- **Utilities:** Timers, reminders, info commands, and a bunch of handy extras

…and that’s just the start! Check the [Modules](./modules/utility) section for everything Toko can do.
