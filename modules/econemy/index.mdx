# Economy

Toko's economy lets your server members earn, spend, and compete for coins in creative ways!

## Features

- **Work & Jobs:**  
  Users can take jobs (randomly assigned from a custom list) to earn coins, with fun/funny messages for success and failure.
- **Cooldowns:**  
  Prevents spam—there's a short cooldown before users can run another economy command.
- **Gambling Mini-Game:**  
  Includes a roulette-style command for betting coins.
- **Eco-Ban:**  
  Mods can ban users from the economy if needed.

## Requirements

- Toko must have permission to send messages and manage roles.
- `jobs.json` data file should be in place (for custom job names).
- Database configured for storing balances.

## Example Commands

- `/work` — Try a random job and earn coins!
- `/balance` — Check your coin balance.
- `/roulette` — Play roulette for a chance to win (or lose) coins.
- `/eco-ban @user` — Ban a user from the economy system.

**Note:** Cooldowns may apply to prevent spam.
