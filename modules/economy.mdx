## Troubleshooting

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Why can't I earn coins?">
    You might be on cooldown from recent activity, or you could have an eco-ban for suspicious behavior. Wait for cooldowns to expire, or contact a server admin if you believe there's an error.
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="I lost all my coins gambling!">
    Gambling involves real risk‚Äîthat's what makes it exciting! All games have transparent odds, and losses are part of the experience. Gamble responsibly and only with coins you can afford to lose.
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Someone has way more coins than me">
    Wealth accumulation takes time and strategy. Focus on consistent earning through jobs, make smart gambling decisions, and remember that everyone started from zero. The leaderboard resets periodically to give everyone fresh chances.
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Economy features aren't working">
    Check if the economy system is enabled on your server and whether you have the necessary permissions. Some features might be restricted to certain roles or channels.
  </AccordionItem>

<Warning>
**Eco-Ban Policy**: Users caught exploiting bugs, using automation, or otherwise cheating the system will be temporarily banned from all economy features. Appeals can be made through server moderators.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: The most successful economy players balance steady job income with calculated gambling risks. Don't put all your coins on one bet!
