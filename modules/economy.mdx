## Economy Balance

<Info>
Our economy system includes built-in safeguards to maintain fairness and prevent abuse.
</Info>

### Fair Play Measures
- **Cooldown Timers**: Prevent spam and maintain realistic earning rates
- **Eco-Ban System**: Automatic penalties for users who attempt to exploit or abuse features
- **Rate Limiting**: Smart restrictions that adapt based on user behavior patterns

### Wealth Distribution
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Earning large amounts becomes increasingly challenging
- **Coin Sinks**: Various ways to spend money keep the economy flowing
- **Inflation Control**: Automatic adjustments prevent currency devaluation

<Warning>
**Eco-Ban Policy**: Users caught exploiting bugs, using automation, or otherwise cheating the system will be temporarily banned from all economy features. Appeals can be made through server moderators.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: The most successful economy players balance steady job income with calculated gambling risks. Don't put all your coins on one bet!
