# Economy System

<Card>
  Welcome to the Economy system! Collect, spend, and gamble virtual coins in the server for fun and bragging rights.
</Card>

## How It Works

<Card>
  You earn coins by working jobs or playing casino games. Use your coins to climb the leaderboard or buy perks (if your server has any).
</Card>

- **Work jobs** to earn a salary (but watch out—sometimes you might fail the interview!).
- **Gamble** in games like roulette and coinflip for a shot at big rewards (or losses).
- **Check your balance** anytime to see how rich you are.
- **See the leaderboard** to find out who’s on top.

## Jobs & Gambling

<Card>
  Get paid for working virtual jobs or take your chances in the casino! Each job comes with its own risks and rewards.
</Card>

- **Apply for jobs** and earn coins over time. Sometimes you might get a funny failure message if things don’t go your way.
- **Casino games** let you risk your coins—will you get lucky, or lose it all?

## Cooldowns & Fair Play

<Card>
  Most economy commands have a cooldown. Please wait a little before trying again to keep things fair.
</Card>

<Warning>
  Abusing or cheating the economy system can get you eco-banned from all economy features.
</Warning>

- You’ll be notified if you’re banned from the economy.

## Troubleshooting

<Card>
  Having issues? Here are some common problems:
</Card>

- **Not earning coins?** You might be on cooldown or eco-banned.
- **Commands not working?** Make sure you’re using the correct prefix and command format.
- **Lost coins in a game?** Gambling is risky—better luck next time!
- **Still stuck?** Ask a server admin for help or check if you’ve been eco-banned.
