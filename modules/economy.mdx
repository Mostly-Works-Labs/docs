## Getting Started

- Use commands like <code>tbal</code> or <code>twork</code> to check your balance and start earning.
- Apply for jobs or play games—see which ones your server has enabled.
- Spend, save, or show off your coins however you want!

<Info>
If you ever get eco-banned, you’ll be notified and won’t be able to use economy features until an admin helps you out.
